### Welcome on a repository dedicated to my Engineering Thesis
# A mock-up of a wood drying kiln 
## Controlled using Raspberry Pi and the AWS Cloud

It is a project that I've made from scratch and involved many areas of knowledge to finish it.

### What was the purpose of this project?
I wanted to create a fully maintainable mock-up of a wood dryer in appropriate scale to be able to carry out the process of drying the wood.  
Did it work?  
#### Of course! ðŸ”¥  

I designed a physical mock-up of a dryer, mounted electrical components, connected them to Raspberry Pi which is heart of this project  
and started collecting data from the periphery.  

I crafted a user interface to manually, from GUI level control every device like radiator, fan that is connected with dryer.  
The dryer is controlled wireless thanks to SSH protocol.  

I used **Python v.3.9.2** to develop a software for this product

Additionally, I decided to connect this project with AWS services to accumulate the data and visualize it to be available worldwide to keep track of it.  
## AWS Services that I used:
* IoT Core,
* Lambda,
* DynamoDB,
* Athena,
* QuickSight
